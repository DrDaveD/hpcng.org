Today, we have involvement from a diverse group of industry, academic, and government partners. Our board is made up of 5 truly great people with a proven track record in HPC. We have a community charter which was developed collaboratively among many organizations completely in the open, for anyone who wants to take part and contribute. This is the same with the management team and all roles within the organization. HPCng was created for the public benefit of the HPC community. This is the organization that Singularity and Warewulf are now proudly part of.</p>\n<p>Earlier this week Sylabs announced that they are forking the Singularity project from HPCng and into their own private organization. As many of you in this community have since pointed out, forking an open source project does not serve the community. While this situation is unfortunate, it is allowed by the Singularity license. However, there has been one major resounding request from the community: for Sylabs to rebrand their fork so as to not cause massive confusion as the projects drift apart. Keeping the same name would conflate bug reports, versions, feature variances, documentation, media, branding, security notices, and the projects themselves.</p>\n<p>Moving forward, we feel this event forces us to accelerate the desired growth within the Singularity project. I will continue to commit resources from my company (CIQ) to help smooth this transition which include the senior Singularity developers (and myself) who have been responsible for building, designing, and architecturing the vast majority of Singularity. But we need more than that, we need your help… participants, volunteers, contributors, leads, managers, maintainers, etc., to take on responsibilities within the project and help guide the direction of the project and HPCng. If you want to be part of this initiative, please join the Slack and say hello (or email me directly), I’d love to hear from you!</p>\n<p>The HPCng board of directors have already been recruiting other organizations and individuals to join and we are currently expanding the project. For example, Brock Taylor (the HPCng Executive Director and Board Member) has been doing a fantastic job pitching the organization to raise awareness about the modernization of HPC and there are a number of large organizations interested in joining this initiative. Also, we are seeing a lot of interest from the cross pollination with enterprise computing use-cases via the visibility that Rocky Linux has created as well as the common lineage from HPCng.</p>\n<p>It will take us a bit of time to regroup so that we can finish up and get Singularity 3.8 released, and the roadmap for 4.0 and beyond, so stay tuned!</p>\n<p>Thank you for your continued support of Singularity.</p>\n<p>—</p>\n<p>Gregory M.
